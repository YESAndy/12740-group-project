### Introduction


### Motivation
Life is not easy for CMU student. Reports said that the average sleeping time of CMU student in at 1:36am. So, working in the night with comfortable light is very essential for every one of us. Also, an energy-saving light system will benefit a lot because it saves money. Based on these reasons, we want to design an automatic indoor light adjustment system to make our lives a little bit easier

### Goals
We want to measure the comfortable level range of light based on personal preference, environmental lightness, existence of human indoor to control the number of LEDs opening automatically. 

## Progress report

### Current Progress
We have read several websites about how to implement and how to write the code to detect the lightness using photoresistor sensors and control the LEDs.


### Problems Encountered
When we are going to implement the whole system using the code we wrote, we found there are some bugs in our code. And now we can't find where the bugs are.



### Future Plan
Describe what you plan to do in the next two weeks
1. We are going to continue to debug our code to make the code and system can run successfully.
2. We are going to design a room, where we can test our detect system and code in serval situations.
